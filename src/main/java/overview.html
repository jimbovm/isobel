		<p>Isobel is a library for working with the level data of 1985's most popular platform game.</p>
		<p>It translates data between the bytecode format used by the original game and a higher-level Java/XML representation suitable for editing. While it can be used by itself, Isobel was developed to be the backend for WYSIWYG level editors. One such editor, Sofia, is planned for the future.</p>
		<p>Isobel provides the core functionality that's required for an editor, abstracting out the original game's area data behind an intermediate object format that can be more easily edited and serialized to XML, and translated to and from bytecode as required.</p>
