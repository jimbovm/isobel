# Isobel

Isobel is a library for working with the level data of 1985's most popular platform game.

It translates data between the bytecode format used by the original game and a higher-level Java/XML representation suitable for editing. While it can be used by itself, Isobel was developed as a backend for WYSIWYG level editors. One such editor, Sofia, is planned for the future.

Isobel provides the core functionality that's required for an editor, abstracting out the original game's area data behind an intermediate object format that can be more easily edited and serialized to XML, and translated to and from bytecode as required.

Isobel is open source, licensed under a public domain-equivalent MIT-0 licence (see `LICENCE.md` for terms) and implemented in Java, so will run anywhere.

## Build instructions

Execute in the root of the cloned repository:

```
./gradlew build
```

To build a portable "fat jar" with all dependencies included:

```
./gradlew fatJar
```

## Documentation

The code is extensively commented and Javadoc'd. Run `./gradlew javadoc` to generate browsable API docs.

## Assembling a game

Isobel's assembly output is designed for use with a ca65-compatible disassembly of the original game; for a compatible disassembly see http://github.com/jimbovm/smb-disassembly. Move output generated by Isobel into the `src` directory of that repository and run `make clean build` once you have provided the required files.
